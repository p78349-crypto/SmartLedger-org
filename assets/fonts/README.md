Place the Korean font file(s) here so the PDF generator can embed them.

Recommended: Download Noto Sans KR Regular (NotoSansKR-Regular.ttf) from Google Fonts and save it as:

  assets/fonts/NotoSansKR-Regular.ttf

After adding the font file, run:

  flutter pub get

Then re-run the app/tests — the PDF generator will embed the font for correct Korean rendering.
