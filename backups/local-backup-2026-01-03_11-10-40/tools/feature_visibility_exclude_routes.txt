# Routes that are intentionally NOT exposed as a main-page feature icon.
#
# This list exists to support the policy:
# - New user-facing features MUST be exposed on a page (MainFeatureIconCatalog)
# - If a route is intentionally hidden (internal/detail/flow-only), add it here
#
# One route constant name per line. Lines starting with # are ignored.
